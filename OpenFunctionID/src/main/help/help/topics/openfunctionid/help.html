<H2><a name="overview"></a>Overview</H2>
<P><i>OpenFiDb</i> is a collaborative Function ID datasets plugin for Ghidra.</P>

<p>The <i>OpenFiDb</i> plugin allows every user to easily get a large dataset of <code>.fidb</code> files. These are used by the plugin <b>FunctionID</b> of Ghidra in order to recognize well known functions signatures based on their binary format.</p>
<p>Once a researcher identified a function in Ghidra, he can share it thanks to the <i>OpenFiDb</i> plugin and it will increase the collaborative dataset.</p>
<p>This plugin uses the repository of threatrack : <a href="https://github.com/threatrack/ghidra-fidb-repo">https://github.com/threatrack/ghidra-fidb-repo</a> as the base of <code>.fidb</code> files. For more information about how it was generated and about which libraries are included, please see the <a href="https://github.com/Cyjanss/OpenFiDb">Online Readme</a></p>
<p>Menus actions can be accessed through <code>Tools->FunctionID->OpenFiDb</code></p>

<H2><a name="pulltherepo"></a>Pull the repository</H2>

<p>The first thing a user of <i>OpenFunctionID</i> would want is to download all available
    <code>FiDbs</code> from the <i>OpenFiDb</i> repository to be able to use them with <b>FunctionID</b>.
    This can be done while accessing to the <i>Pull the repo</i> menu entry. Some popup
    windows inform the user and then all <code>FiDbs</code> are downloaded to the local installation
    of <i>OpenFunctionID</i>. Currently, the repository contains 64 MiB of <code>FiDbs</code> and is
    expected to grow thanks to the community. Thus, a loading screen is displayed
    while downloading. The CodeBrowser tool has a scripting console where some
    information is printed by OpenFunctionID to inform the user of the process. An
    example of this console after download of the repository is shown in image below.</p>

<p>At first, it will clone the repository, afterwards it will only pull incoming changes.</p>

<p>Once the download is finished, a popup window appears
    prompting the user which <code>FiDb</code> he wants to use.</p>

<p><img src="img/selectActive.png" alt="Select FiDbs to use after pulling OpenFiDb repository"></p>

<p>Although all FiDbs have been
    uploaded, not all of them will be of interest to all researchers. They have the
    possibility to check <code>Fidbs</code> that they want to attach and use, depending on the
    processor for example. The name of each <code>FiDb</code> is composed by a name and the
    Language. After this, <i>OpenFiDb</i> <code>Fidbs</code> are used by <b>FunctionID</b> to recognise function
    names. If the user wants to select and use other <code>FiDbs</code>, he can use the <b>FunctionID</b>
    plugin.</p>

<H2><a name="delete"></a>Delete all local OpenFiDb files</H2>
<p>If a user wants to get rid of all the <code>FiDbs</code> provided by <i>OpenFunctionID</i>, he can
    choose the last menu entry called <i>Delete all OpenFiDb files</i>. It will remove the
    folder containing the local version of the <i>OpenFiDb</i> repository.</p>

<H2><a name="discardlocal"></a>Discard all local changes</H2>

<p><b>FunctionID</b> Plugin allows users to populate an existing <code>FiDb</code>. Although it is not
    recommended nor useful to populate an <code>FiDb</code> coming from <i>OpenFiDb</i>, it is possible.
    If it happens, the pull action described here before would not work since local
    changes are not committed. While <i>OpenFiDb</i> could have handled it itself and
    automatically discarded local changes, it was decided to not doing it without user
    agreement. To allow him to save elsewhere his local changes to <code>FiDbs</code>, another
    button in the menu is created and called <i>Discard local changes</i>.</p>

<H2><a name="upload"></a>Upload to OpenFiDb</H2>
<p>The server is down, this functionnality has been depreciated. The community database of <code>.fidb</code> has been removed.</p>
